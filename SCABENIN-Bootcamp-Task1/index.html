    </head>

    <body>
        <div >
        <h2>JavaScript Home</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is easy to learn. It is used to program the behavior of web pages. JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>JavaScript Introduction</h2>
        <p>Javascript can change HTML content by using <b>getElementById()</b>. It can also change HTML attribute values, e.g. changing the source value of an image,and also change CSS styles e.g the font-size,hide or show HTML elements. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>JavaScript in body</h2>
        <p>JavaScript code can be placed in the <b>&lt;body&gt;</b> section, <b>&lt; head &gt;</b> section or in both of an HTML page. Externally, it could be placed in external files with <b>.js</b> file extension. External scripts is preferred because it separates HTML and code, it makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>JavaScript Output</h2>
        <p>JavaScript can display data by using: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>innerHTML.</li>
                <li>document.write() which is useful for testing purposes. </li>
                <li>window.alert</li>
                <li>console.log() for debugging purposes</li>
                <li>window.print() to print the content from the current window.</li>

            </ol>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>JavaScript Statement</h2>
        <p>JavaScript statements are composed of: <b>Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments</b>. JavaScript statements are separated by <b>Semicolons</b>.There are lot of JavaScript keywords like var, if...else  etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>JavaScript Syntax</h2>
<p>The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values: <b>Fixed values</b> which are also called <i>literals</i> and <b>Variable values</b> also called <i>variables</i>. JavaScript uses the <i>var</i> keyword to declare variables and an equal sign(=) is used to assign values to variables. JavaScript is case sensitive. JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter:firstName, masterCard.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>JavaScript Comments</h2>
<p>The comment tag is used to explain codes or stop the codes from being executed by JavaScript. Single line comments starts with // and ends with //. Any text between these lines will not be executed by JavaScript. Multi-line comments starts with /* and ends with */. </p>
</div> 
<div>
<h2>JavaScript Variables</h2>
<p>Variables must be identified by unique names called <b>Identifiers</b>. JavaScript data types are mainly strings which are usually enclosed with either a single or double quotes, and numbers which are without quotes. You can declare many variables in one statement. A variable declared without a value will have the value <emp>undefined</emp>. </p> 
</div>
<div>
<h2>JavaScript Operators</h2>
<p>Some of the operators include = which assigns data values, + which adds numbers and concatenate strings,/for division. Others include *-multiplication, ** exponetation etc. The addition assignment operator (+=) adds a value to a variable and concatenate strings.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>JavaScript Arithmetic</h2>
<p>The numbers (in an arithmetic operation) are called <b>Operands</b>. The operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an operator. Some of the operators include:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The addition operator (+) adds numbers</li>
        <li>The subtraction operator (-) subtracts numbers</li>
        <li>The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers</li>
        <li>The division operator (/) divides numbers</li>
        <li>The modulus operator (%) returns the division remainder</li>
        <li>The increment operator (++) increments numbers</li>
        <li>The decrement operator (--) decrements numbers</li>
        <li>The exponentiation operator (**) raises the first operand to the power of the second operand</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It is important to note that x ** y produces the same result as Math.pow(x,y)</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>JavaScript assignment</h2>
    <p>Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables. They include <b>=, =+, =-, =*, =*, =% </b>etc.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>JavaScript Data Types</h2>
    <p>These data types include:
        <ol>
            <li>Numbers- written in either single or double strings</li>
            <li>Strings -written either with or without decimals.</li>
            <li>Object -written with curly braces. e.g {firstName:"John",lastName:"Doe",age:12};</li>
            <li>Boolean- returns either true or false.</li>
            <li>Arrays- begins with a square bracket and each item is separated by a comma. e.g var cars["volvo", "audi", "benz"]</li>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>JavaScript Functions</h2>
<p> JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses (). Functions are encouraged because You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results. Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.
</p>    
</div>
<div>
    <h2>JavaScript Objects</h2>
    <p>Objects are variables that contain many values. Methods are actions that can be performed by an object.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>JavaScript Event</h2>
        <p>HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements either with single or double quotes. It is more common to see event attributes calling functions.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>JavaScript Strings</h2>
    <p> JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes. They are used for storing and manipulating text. You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string. To find the length of a string, use the built-in <b>length</b> property</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>JavaScript String Methods</h2>
    <p>The <b>length</b> property returns the length of a string. The <b>indexOf()</b> method returns the index of (the position of) the first occurrence of a specified text in a string. The <b>lastIndexOf()</b> method returns the index of the last occurrence of a specified text in a string. Both indexOf(), and lastIndexOf() return -1 if the text is not found. The search() method searches a string for a specified value and returns the position of the match. There are 3 methods of extracting a string.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>slice(start,end)</li>
        <li>substrings(start,end)</li>
        <li>substr(start, length</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The replace() method replaces a specified value with another value in a string. A string is converted to upper case with <b>toUpperCase()</b>. A string is converted to lower case with <b>toLowerCase()</b>. The <b>concat()</b> method can be used instead of the plus operator. The <b>trim()</b> method removes whitespace from both sides of a string</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>JavaScript Numbers</h2>
    <p>Numbers can be written with or without decimals. If you add two numbers, the result will be a number. E.g var x= 10;var y = 20; var z = x + y; which is 10 + 20 = 30. If you add two strings, the result will be a string concatenation, e.g var x="5"; var y ="9"; var z = x + y,which will be 59. If you add a number and a string, the result will be a string concatenation. If you add a string and a number, the result will be a string concatenation. Trying to do arithmetic with a non-numeric string will result in NaN (Not a Number).</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>JavaScript Number Methods</h2>
    <p>The <b>toString()</b> method returns a number as a string.<br> E.g. var x = 123;
        x.toString();            // returns 123 from variable x
    <br>
    <b>toExponential()</b> returns a string, with a number rounded and written using exponential notation.
<br>
var x = 9.656;
x.toExponential(2);     // returns 9.66e+0
x.toExponential(4);     // returns 9.6560e+0
<br>
<b>toFixed()</b> returns a string, with the number written with a specified number of decimals.<br> E.g.var x = 9.656;
x.toFixed(0);           // returns 10
x.toFixed(2);           // returns 9.66
<br>
<b>toPrecision()</b> returns a string, with a number written with a specified length.
<br>E.g.var x = 9.656;
x.toPrecision();        // returns 9.656
x.toPrecision(2);       // returns 9.7
<br><b>valueOf()</b> returns a number as a number</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>JavaScript Arrays</h2>
    <p>An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time. E.g var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];. You access an array element by referring to the index number. <b>Note</b>: Array indexes start with 0. The length property of an array returns the length of an array (the number of array elements).</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>JavaScript Array Methods</h2>
    <p>The JavaScript method <b>toString()</b> converts an array to a string of (comma separated) array values. The join() method also joins all array elements into a string. E.g. var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fruits.join(" * "); it gives this result: Banana * Orange * Apple * Mango. The <p>pop()</p> method removes the last element from an array. The <p>push()</p> method adds a new element to an array (at the end). The <p>shift()</p> method removes the first array element and "shifts" all other elements to a lower index. The <b>unshift()</b> method adds a new element to an array (at the beginning), and "unshifts" older elements. The <b>splice()</b> method can be used to add new items to an array. The <b>concat()</b> method creates a new array by merging (concatenating) existing arrays</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>JavaScript Sorting Arrays</h2>
    <p>The <b>sort()</b>method sorts an array alphabetically. The <b>reverse()</b> is used to sort an array in descending order. The purpose of the compare function is to define an alternative sort order. To arrange an array in a random manner, we use the <b>Fisher Yates shuffle</b>. You can use Math.max.apply to find the highest number in an array. </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>JavaScript Array Iteration Methods</h2>
    <p>It includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Array.for each()- It calls a function (a callback function) once for each array element.</li>
        <li>Array.map()- It creates a new array by performing a function on each array element.</li>
        <li>Array.filter()- It creates a new array with array elements that passes a test.</li>
        <li>Array.reduce()- </li>
        <li>Array.reduceRight()-  runs a function on each array element to produce (reduce it to) a single value.</li>
        <li>Array.every()-It checks if all array values pass a test.</li>
        <li>Array.some()- The some() method check if some array values pass a test.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>JavaScript Dates</h2>
    <p>Date objects are created with the <b>new Date()</b> constructor. <b>new Date(dateString)</b> creates a new date object from a date string. Date methods allow you to get and set the year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond of date objects, using either local time or UTC (universal, or GMT) time.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>JavaScript Date Formats</h2>
    <p>There are 3 types of JavaScript date input formats</p>
    <ul>
        <li>ISO Date e.g:2015-03-15.</li>
        <li>Short Date E.g: 03/15/2015</li>
        <li>Long Date e.g. Mar 15 2015</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can use the<b> Date.parse()</b> method to convert it to milliseconds. It returns the number of milliseconds between the date and January 1, 1970.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>JavaScript Get Date Methods</h2>
    <p>These methods can be used for getting information from a date object. They include:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
        <th>Method</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
           <td> getFullYear()</td>
           <td>Get the year as a four digit number (yyyy)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>getMonth()</td>
        <td>Get the month as a number (0-11)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>getDate()</td>
        <td>Get the day as a number (1-31)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>getHours()</td>
        <td>Get the hour (0-23)</td>
    </tr>
    </table>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>JavaScript Set Date Methods</h2>
    <p>Set Date methods let you set date values (years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds) for a Date Object. The Set Date methods include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>setDate():	Set the day as a number (1-31)</li>
        <li>setFullYear():	Set the year (optionally month and day)</li>
        <li>setHours():	Set the hour (0-23)</li>
        <li>setMilliseconds():	Set the milliseconds (0-999)</li>
        <li>setMinutes():	Set the minutes (0-59)</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>JavaScript Math Object</h2>
    <p>It allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers. They include: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Math.PI - returns 3.141592653589793</li>
        <li>Math.round(x) - returns the value of x rounded to its nearest integer</li>
        <li>Math.pow(x, y) - returns the value of x to the power of y</li>
        <li>Math.sqrt(x) - returns the square root of x</li>
        <li>Math.abs(x) - returns the absolute (positive) value of x</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>JavaScript Random</h2>
    <p>Math.random() returns a random number between 0 (inclusive),  and 1 (exclusive). Math.random() used with Math.floor() can be used to return random integers.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>JavaScript Booleans</h2>
    <p>A JavaScript Boolean represents one of two values: true or false. The Boolean value of an expression is the basis for all JavaScript comparisons and conditions. Everything With a "Value" is True. Everything Without a "Value" is False.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>JavaScript Comparison and Logical Operators</h2>
    <p>Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values. Some of these operators include:<b>==, ===, !=, !==,>, <, <=, >=. </b>. Comparison operators can be used in conditional statements to compare values and take action depending on the result. Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values. They include: <b>&&, ||, !</b>. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>JavaScript Conditions</h2>
        <p>Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true</li>
    <li>Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false</li>
    <li>Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false</li>
    <li>Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>JavaScript Switch</h2>
            <p>The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions. The <b>getDay()</b> method returns the weekday as a number between 0 and 6. A <b>break</b> keyword breaks out of the switch block. It stops the execution of inside the block. The <b>default</b> keyword specifies the code to run if there is no case match. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>JavaScript For Loop</h2>
            <p>Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value. JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>for - loops through a block of code a number of times</li>
              <li>for/in - loops through the properties of an object</li>
              <li>for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object</li>
              <li>while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true</li>
              <li>do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true</li>
            </ul>         
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>JavaScript While Loop</h2>
            <p>The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. The do/while loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>JavaScript Break and Continue</h2>
            <p>The break statement "jumps out" of a loop. The continue statement "jumps over" one iteration in the loop. To label JavaScript statements you precede the statements with a label name and a colon. The break and the continue statements are the only JavaScript statements that can "jump out of" a code block.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>JavaScript Type Conversion</h2>
            <p>The data type of NaN is number. The data type of an array is object. The data type of a date is object. The data type of null is object. The data type of an undefined variable is undefined. The data type of a variable that has not been assigned a value is also undefined.The <b>constructor</b> property returns the constructor function for all JavaScript variables.The global method Number() can be used to convert dates to numbers. he global method Number() can also convert booleans to numbers. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>JavaScript Bitwise Operations</h2>
            <p>When a bitwise AND is performed on a pair of bits, it returns 1 if both bits are 1. When a bitwise OR is performed on a pair of bits, it returns 1 if one of the bits are 1. When a bitwise XOR is performed on a pair of bits, it returns 1 if the bits are different. One or more zero bits are pushed in from the right, and the leftmost bits fall off. In a sign preserving right shift copies of the leftmost bit are pushed in from the left, and the rightmost bits fall off. For a zero fill right shift,one or more zero bits are pushed in from the left, and the rightmost bits fall off </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>JavaScript Regular Expressions</h2>
            <p>A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations. In JavaScript, regular expressions are often used with the two string methods: search() and replace(). The search() method uses an expression to search for a match, and returns the position of the match. The replace() method returns a modified string where the pattern is replaced. The <b>search()</b> method searches a string for a specified value and returns the position of the match. You can use a <b>regular expression</b> to do a case-insensitive search in a string. In JavaScript, the RegExp object is a regular expression object with predefined properties and methods. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>JavaScript Errors</h2>
            <p>The <b>try</b> statement lets you test a block of code for errors. The<b> catch</b> statement lets you handle the error. The <b>throw</b> statement lets you create custom errors. The finally statement lets you execute code, after try and catch, regardless of the result.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>JavaScript Scope</h2>
        <p>In JavaScript there are two types of scope:</p>
<uL>
            <li>Local scope</li>
            <li> Global scope</li>
        </uL>
        <p>Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function. If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, it will automatically become a GLOBAL variable. The lifetime of a JavaScript variable starts when it is declared. Local variables are deleted when the function is completed. In a web browser, global variables are deleted when you close the browser window (or tab).</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>JavaScript Hoisting</h2>
        <p>Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top. Variables and constants declared with let or const are not hoisted!. If a developer doesn't understand hoisting, programs may contain bugs (errors). To avoid bugs, always declare all variables at the beginning of every scope. Since this is how JavaScript interprets the code, it is always a good rule.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>JavaScript Use Strict</h2>
        <p><b>"use strict";</b> Defines that JavaScript code should be executed in "strict mode". Strict mode is declared by adding "use strict"; to the beginning of a script or a function. The "use strict" directive is only recognized at the beginning of a script or a function.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>The JavaScript <b>this</b> Keyword</h2>
        <p>The JavaScript <i>this</i> keyword refers to the object it belongs to. The call() and apply() methods are predefined JavaScript methods. They can both be used to call an object method with another object as argument. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>JavaScript Let</h2>
        <p>Redeclaring a variable using the var keyword can impose problems. Redeclaring a variable using the let keyword can solve this problem. Using let, the variable declared in the loop does not redeclare the variable outside the loop. Variables declared with var and let are quite similar when declared outside a block. Global variables defined with the let keyword do not belong to the window object. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>JavaScript Const</h2>
        <p>Variables defined with const behave like let variables, except they cannot be reassigned. JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared. The keyword const is a little misleading. It does NOT define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value. Because of this, we cannot change constant primitive values, but we can change the properties of constant objects. Redeclaring or reassigning an existing var or let variable to const, in the same scope, or in the same block, is not allowed. Redeclaring a variable with const, in another scope, or in another block, is allowed.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Arrow Function</h2>
        <p>Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>JavaScript Debugging</h2>
        <p>Searching for (and fixing) errors in programming code is called code debugging. If your browser supports debugging, you can use <b>console.log()</b> to display JavaScript values in the debugger window. In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code.

            At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values.
            After examining values, you can resume the execution of code (typically with a play button).</p>
    </div>

    <h2>JavaScript Style Guide and Coding Conventions</h2>
    <p>Coding conventions are style guidelines for programming. Always put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ), and after commas. Always use 2 spaces for indentation of code blocks. Always end a simple statement with a semicolon. For complex (compound) statements,put the opening bracket at the end of the first line. Use one space before the opening bracket, put the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces. Do not end a complex statement with a semicolon.  For object definitions,place the opening bracket on the same line as the object name, use colon plus one space between each property and its value, use quotes around string values, not around numeric values, do not add a comma after the last property-value pair,place the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces, always end an object definition with a semicolon. For readability, avoid lines longer than 80 characters. Always use the same naming convention for all your code. For example:</p>
<uL>
       <li>Variable and function names written as camelCase</li>
       <li>Global variables written in UPPERCASE (We don't, but it's quite common)</li>
       <li>Constants (like PI) written in UPPERCASE</li>
    </uL>
    <p>Use simple syntax for loading external scripts (the type attribute is not necessary). If possible, use the same naming convention (as JavaScript) in HTML.</p>

        <h2>JavaScript Best Practices</h2>
        <p>Avoid global variables, avoid new, avoid ==, avoid eval(). All variables used in a function should be declared as local variables. Local variables must be declared with the var keyword or the let keyword, otherwise they will become global variables. It is a good coding practice to put all declarations at the top of each script or function. It is a good coding practice to initialize variables when you declare them. Always treat numbers, strings, or booleans as primitive values. Not as objects. </p>

        <h2>JavaScript Common Mistakes</h2>
        <p>avaScript programs may generate unexpected results if a programmer accidentally uses an assignment operator (=), instead of a comparison operator (==) in an if statement. Adding a number as a number will produce a different result from adding a number as a string. JavaScript will allow you to break a statement into two lines, but breaking a statement in the middle of a string will not work. You must use a "backslash" if you must break a statement in a string. Never break a return statement.</p>
